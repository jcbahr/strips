set of start state
set of goal state
list for plan
stack for set of nodes


program name
============
STRIPS C planner using Bison and Flex

SCUBA is a good name
STRIPS
C
but it's been used and isn't google-able

STRIPS planner with bison and flex in c
spwbafic
no

STRIPS algorithm with lisp-y input
sawli - maybe

STRIPS Planner with a LISP style input
spwalsi
spalsi - sounds stupid
spali - no




Do I want these structs as types in yylval?
I think so

typdef struct action_list:
	char * name
	char ** parameters


typedef struct fluent:
	char * var
	char ** obj

	



I want a loop
	print name
	does next exist?
		continue
	else
		stop



start:	(A on B), (B on TABLE)
goal:	(A on TABLE), (B on A)

actions:	(take (X, Y)
			preconditions: (X on Y)
			add: (have X)
			delete: (X on Y)

		(put (X, Y)
			preconditions: (have X)
			add: (X on Y)
			delete: (have X)

__strips__

stack: '(A on TABLE), (B on A)'
plan: ''

pop (A on TABLE) off of the stack
is there an action that results in (A on TABLE)?
(put (A, TABLE)) does it

stack: '(have A), (put (A on TABLE)), (B on TABLE)'
plan: ''

pop (have A) off of the stack
is there an action that results in (have A)?
(take (A, ?!?!)) does it				This is the variable instantiation problem
